# pi_pico_hid_attack
This repo has all the files necessary to convert your Pi Pico into a bad USB/USB Rubber Ducky.
##note:
You don't need to convert the 'payload.dd' file into a rubber ducky compatible file,
the pico will execute the attack as soon as it is compiled or connected to the computer

## first:
Paste the 'adafruit-circuitpython-raspberry_pi_pico-en_US-9.1.0-beta.1.uf2' file and wait for it to finish

## second:
Copy all the other files from the main files folder

## third:
Paste your 'payload.dd' onto your Pi Pico
