# pi_pico_hid_attack
This repo has all the files necessary to convert your Pi Pico into a bad USB/USB Rubber Ducky.

You don't need to convert the 'payload.dd' file into a rubber ducky compatible file,
the pico will execute the attack as soon as it is compiled or connected to the computer

## first:
Paste the circuit Python file and wait for it to finish

## second:
Copy all the other files

## third:
Paste your 'payload.dd' onto your Pi Pico
